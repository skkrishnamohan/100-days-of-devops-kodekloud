## Day 04: Grant Executable Permissions to Backup Script

In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named `xfusioncorp.sh`. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 1 within the Stratos Datacenter.

**Task:**
